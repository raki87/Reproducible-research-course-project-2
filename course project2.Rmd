#* WEATHER EVENTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA*

##*SYNOPSIS*


"In this report , an analysis about the impact of Storms and other severe weather events are done. These events  causes both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern."

 "This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage."

## *WRANGLING OF THE DATA*

"Defining the various set of variables that is available from the data set"

"-EVTYPE: Event Type (Tornados, Flood, â€¦.)"

 "- FATALITIES: Number of Fatalities"
 
 "- INJURIES: Number of Injuries"
 
 "- PROPDMG: Property Damage"
 
 "- PROPDMGEXP: Units for Property Damage (magnitudes - K,B,M)"
 
 "- CROPDMG: Crop Damage"
 
 "- CROPDMGEXP: Units for Crop Damage (magnitudes - K,BM,B)"

## *RESULTS*

" 1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?"

    "Tornado's causes the highest number of Fatalities and Injuries from the given data set."
    
    
" 2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?"
  
    "Floods causes highest  rates in property damages  and droughts causes the highest rate in crop damages."
